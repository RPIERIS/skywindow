        <br>
        <p>It was September 2019. I had just moved into the cheapest flat I could find in the area.
           This was a flat far from transport links. A flat on the second floor. My only
           requirement when looking for a flat was that the landlord allow me to keep my two bicycles
           inside the flat. This one had been quite modern and had a decent kitchen. I enjoy cooking
           and its important to have a good kitchen. One of the many benefits I took away from being married to a
           sophisticated woman was a love of good food. Sadly I also became a bit more eccentric and that was
           that.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was a keen gardener in my house and I always ate breakfast looking at the garden. I was going
           to miss my garden and I hoped one day to have another garden like that one. I think the deities must
           have been reading my mind. That morning I opended the window to see this amazing sight. A cloud formation
           that looked like <strong><em>a mountain chain in the sky</em></strong>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In all my time living I had never looked up at the sky and gazed in amazement as that morning.
           I wish you could have been there because the camera in my phone is no way as good as the
           human eye. The clouds looked like an upsidedown landscape. The jutting clouds were creating
           shadows all over...<strong><em>it took my breath away</em></strong>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I dont think I will see such a beautiful sight again but I was fortunate to have been welcomed to the
           new property by this view. One year on and I am being evicted. The landlord wants to sell it. I hope the
           next occupant will enjoy it as much as I have.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I hope you, like me, will look up and see the beauty of the sky. I came across
           <a href="https://matadornetwork.com/bnt/60-insane-cloud-formations-from-around-the-world-pics/" class="underline">
           60 insane cloud formations</a> at the matadornetwork. I hope you enjoy these as much
           as I do. As the <a href="https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/" class="underline">Cloud Apreciation Society</a> says
           in its manifesto:</p>
        <br>
        <blockquote cite="https://cloudappreciationsociety.org/manifesto/">"Look up, marvel at the ephemeral beauty, and always
          remember to live life with your head in the clouds!"
        </blockquote>

        <p>I am Ran. As you can guess I like cycling.
          I also like the looking at the sky. That is whenever
          I am not sitting in front of a computer. This blog is about
          the beautiful sights I see from my windows in the bedroom, living
          room and kitchen. I currently work in finance but I am hoping to move to become a front
          end web developer in the next two years.
